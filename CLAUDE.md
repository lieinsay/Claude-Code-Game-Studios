# Claude Code Game Studios -- Game Studio Agent Architecture

Indie game development managed through 48 coordinated Claude Code subagents.
Each agent owns a specific domain, enforcing separation of concerns and quality.

## Technology Stack

- **Engine**: Godot 4.6.2 .NET
- **Language**: C#
- **Version Control**: Git with trunk-based development
- **Build System**: Godot .NET CLI/editor build + `dotnet build`
- **Asset Pipeline**: Godot native import system (.tscn, .tres, .gd)

> **Note**: This project now targets desktop Godot .NET/C#. Route code work to
> `godot-csharp-specialist`; use `godot-specialist` for scene architecture and
> `godot-shader-specialist` for rendering/shader questions.

## Collaboration Protocol

**User-driven collaboration, not autonomous execution.**
Every task follows: **Question -> Options -> Decision -> Draft -> Approval**

- Agents MUST ask "May I write this to [filepath]?" before using Write/Edit tools
- Agents MUST show drafts or summaries before requesting approval
- Multi-file changes require explicit approval for the full changeset
- No commits without user instruction

See `docs/COLLABORATIVE-DESIGN-PRINCIPLE.md` for full protocol and examples.

> **First session?** If the project has no engine configured and no game concept,
> run `/start` to begin the guided onboarding flow.
